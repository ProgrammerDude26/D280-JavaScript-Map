Overview:

Due to Angular having so many big changes with their versions over the years it took some time understanding what was
needed to be learned vs discarded like with NGModule and Standalone but once I got deep into some tutorials and see how
things were supposed to behave it started to come together and after 3 attempts I have an Interactive Map!
(Along with a VanillaJS version). I am going to attempt to clean it up and do some more styling and get my file size
down by eliminating any nonsense files.

1st Build: Using Angular I could not get the data to display on the table and GitLab wasn't showing my pushes,
           so after a while I decided to just restart and rebuild the project.

2nd Build: I got Git to start pushing to Gitlab properly using IntelliJ IDEA but, and got my project to work, but I only
           created the project with Angular and didn't build it with Angular just VanillaJS after talking to my CI.
           my CI stated that the branch I was pushing to was okay despite it not being named properly he stated he was
           more worried about the proper implementation and use of Angular.

3rd Build: I used the same GitLab pipeline as my CI Chris Peters said it wouldn't be a problem with the branch named Master
           and I didn't want to risk having the problem from my first build and fearing I wouldn't be able to push my steps
           properly. Thankfully on my 3rd Build I was able to get my map interactive using Angular.

Thanks for reviewing my project!
